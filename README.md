# HEFT-Algorithm
Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (or HEFT) is a heuristic to schedule a set of dependent tasks onto a network of heterogeneous workers taking communication time into account.[1] For inputs HEFT takes a set of tasks, represented as a directed acyclic graph, a set of workers, the times to execute each task on each worker, and the times to communicate the results from each job to each of its children between each pair of workers. It descends from list scheduling algorithms.
